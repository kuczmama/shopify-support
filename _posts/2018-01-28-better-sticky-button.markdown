## Why optimize your store for mobile shopping?

## I accidentally deleted the advanced settings and now nothing works

### Buy Button Selector

### Review Stars 
<pre>.yotpo-stars:first, .spr-badge-starrating:first, .spr-starrating:first</pre>

## What is the desktop/mobile reveal at?
The mobile/desktop reveal at is how far you need to scroll down for the better sticky button to become visible.  It is defaulted at 100px.  But if you want it to be always visible set it to 0.  Or if you want it to be a bit further down, set it to a higher number like 150 or 200.

## What are the 'Currency Symbols"?
Currency symbols are how the numbers are formatted.  Let's imagine we were showing the number $2170.50.

**Blank:** The price won't be displayed

**Default::** 2,171.50

**Amount no decimals:** 2171

**Amount with comma seperator:** 2170,50

**Amount No Decimals with comma separator:** 2171

**Amount with apostrophe separator:** 2170'50

**Amount no decimals with space separator:** 2171

**Amount:** 2170.50

## What is the mobile/desktop z-index?
Imagine you had a stack of papers numbered 1-10.  The page with #10 is at the top, and #1 is at the bottom of the stack.  If you added a new page with #5, it would go in the middle of the stack.  If you added one with a #11, it would go at the top of the stack.  Or if you added one with #9999, it would go above everything.  

Each element on a webpage has their own number or z-index, which says what overlaps what.  So if you want to have the 'Better Sticky Button' be over everything else, update your z-index to a very high value like 99999.

## How Can I preview the button animation? Why isn't the animation preview doing anything?
To view the button animation, you need to click on the "Preview Animation" button in the animation settings.  Note that when you click this button it will save the settings.

# What is the difference between mobile and full for the "Mobile Design Templates"?
- Mobile: Only have the buy button visible.
- Full: Allows for additional options.  ie. choose alternative product variants, product title, etc.

# What does it mean to "Skip add to cart and go directly to checkout"
When you Skip the add to cart and go directly to checkout, your user will skip the add to cart step.  When they go directly to the checkout, they will have one less click.  This can increase conversions.
