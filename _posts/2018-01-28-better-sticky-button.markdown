## What is the mobile/desktop z-index?
Imagine you had a stack of papers numbered 1-10.  The page with #10 is at the top, and #1 is at the bottom of the stack.  If you added a new page with #5, it would go in the middle of the stack.  If you added one with a #11, it would go at the top of the stack.  Or if you added one with #9999, it would go above everything.  

Each element on a webpage has their own number or z-index, which says what overlaps what.  So if you want to have the 'Better Sticky Button' be over everything else, update your z-index to a very high value like 99999.
